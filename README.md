## Development Status

Supported: [**Ctrip**](http://ctrip.com).

Not yet Supported: [**Fliggy**](https://www.fliggy.com/), [**Qunar**](https://www.qunar.com),  [**Ly**](https://www.ly.com/),  [**Suanya**](http://www.suanya.cn/), and much more.


## Requirements

This app is targeted at **Java 8**, so these are all you will need:

- A **COMPUTER** that can run **Java**.
  - You need a  **COMPUTER** to run this app! `Android` and `iOS` are not yet supported.
- [Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8+](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
  - The chances are that you might have **Java** installed already if you played games like `Minecraft` before, but I encourage you to grab the latest version just for the sake of updating it.
  - <del>需要 **Java** 下载网页的中文版？可以[点这里试试！](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/cn/java/javase/downloads/index.html)请确保下载的是 **JRE 8 或更新的版本！**。</del>
  - 中文版网页版本更新速度太慢了，还是去英文官网吧2333...

## Getting Started

**First: Goto the [release page](https://github.com/jerryc05/FlightPriceCrawler/releases) and download the JAR file!**

**Then: Launch the app!**

- I'm using Windows
> You are completely fine. Just **<kbd>double-click</kbd>** the jar file and you are all set.

- I'm using Mac
> A simpler way of doing this is to locate the app file in Finder and **<kbd>Ctrl-Click</kbd>** it, and select **<kbd>Open</kbd>** from the resultant menu. 
> **NOTE THAT** an exception might be created for opening it normally (i.e. **<kbd>double-clicking</kbd>**).

- I'm using Linux 
> I do not know! It has never been tested.

**Finally: an excel worksheet will pop up if crawing succeeded.**
